# Introduction to python, a complementary to our programming course intro.

After successfully installing python to your computer hello world is always a great way to check if everything installed correctly.

## 1. Hello World!
Output `hello world!` in console.  

Tips: if you really need help, google [Python output](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Python+output)

## 2. Add two numbers.
Output `a + b = c`

Tips: use input to assign values to `a` and `b` then output the sum of them.

## 3. Find the square root.

Output example `sqrt(9) = 3`

Tips: Use multiplication.

## 4. Calculate area of a triangle

Output example: `The area of the triangle is 7.50` (input base = 5, height = 3)

Tips: input base and height. Use float for right formatting.

## 5. Swap two variables.

Output example: 
```bash
Input X = variable1
Input Y = variable2

Output value of X after the swap is: variable2
Output value of Y after the swap is: variable1
```
Tips: Use a temp variable.

## 6. Convert Kilometers to Miles.
Output example: `10.00 Kilometers equals 6.21 Miles`

Tips: Conversion factor is 0.621371

## 7. Is a number negative or positive?
Output example `-5 is negative`

Tips: Input a number, then use [if statement](http://anh.cs.luc.edu/handsonPythonTutorial/ifstatements.html) to check it and printout the answer.

## 8. Check Leap year.
This is a brain teaser..

Output ´1920 is a leap year´

Tips: Leap year is every 4th year, years ending with 00 is not a leap year, except every 400 year.

## 9. Print calendar month
Sounds more challanging right?  
Output example
```bash
    August 2018
Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su
       1  2  3  4  5
 6  7  8  9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16 17 18 19
20 21 22 23 24 25 26
27 28 29 30 31
```
This is very easy with the help of the library *surprice surprice* `calendar`

Tips: Here again, google is your friend. Sometimes reading a long documentation of a library can be intriguing..
Google more specific will give you a better example: ["print calendar month with python"](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/How-to-print-calendar-for-a-month-in-Python).
