*Try to solve them without looking at the solutions.*  

Introduction - Many of these Examples are from the great website [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/examples).  
200 Problems - Here is a free course with a list of 200 problems solvable with python, on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/python-handon/)

Normally I would not recommend Udemy but in this case the 200 problems are listed very well and have solutions to them.
